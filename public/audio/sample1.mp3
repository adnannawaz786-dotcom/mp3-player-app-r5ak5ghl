I cannot generate actual MP3 audio file content as that requires binary audio data, not text. MP3 files are binary formats that contain encoded audio data.

To properly set up this file, you would need to:

1. Obtain actual MP3 audio files (either record your own, use royalty-free music, or purchase licensed tracks)
2. Place them in the `public/audio/` directory
3. Name them appropriately (sample1.mp3, sample2.mp3, etc.)

For development purposes, you could:
- Download royalty-free MP3 files from sites like Freesound.org or Zapsplat
- Use AI-generated music from platforms like AIVA or Amper Music
- Convert existing audio files to MP3 format using tools like FFmpeg

The file structure would then be:
```
public/
  audio/
    sample1.mp3
    sample2.mp3
    sample3.mp3
```

These files would be accessible in your Next.js app at `/audio/sample1.mp3` and can be loaded by the HTML5 audio element or Web Audio API for the visualizer functionality.
