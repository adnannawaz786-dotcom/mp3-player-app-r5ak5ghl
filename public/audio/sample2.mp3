I cannot generate actual MP3 audio file content as text. MP3 files are binary audio files that contain encoded audio data, not text content.

To properly set up this file, you would need to:

1. Obtain a real MP3 audio file (sample track, royalty-free music, etc.)
2. Place it in the `public/audio/` directory
3. Name it `sample2.mp3`

For development purposes, you could:
- Download royalty-free music from sites like Freesound.org or Pixabay
- Use a text-to-speech generator to create a sample MP3
- Record a short audio clip and convert it to MP3
- Use online MP3 generators for test audio

The file should be a standard MP3 format that can be played by HTML5 audio elements in browsers.
